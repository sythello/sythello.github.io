        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.

		<strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting  industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever  since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and  scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only  five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,  remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with  the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and  more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker  including versions of Lorem Ipsum. </p>

        <p> Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It  has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making  it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at  Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure  Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through  the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the  undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33  of &quot;de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum&quot; (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by  Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of  ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem  Ipsum, &quot;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..&quot;, comes from a line in section  1.10.32. </p>

        <p> <br />
The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced  below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from &quot;de  Finibus Bonorum et Malorum&quot; by Cicero are also reproduced in their  exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914  translation by H. Rackham. </p>

        <h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>

        <p>
         Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting  industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever  since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and  scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only  five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,  remaining essentially unchanged.

        <h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
        <p> It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the  readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of  using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of  letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it  look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web  page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a  search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their  infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by  accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like). </p>
